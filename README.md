# A_B_test-ecommerce site

This is an AB test using ecommerce site data to determine if the new site is better than the old site for converting users.
Regression and bootstraping methods were used to determine the conclusion. 

It is recommended that the company continue their testing if there is enough time, or look at different predictors like click through rate or duration on a given page and let these results inform them on a different design, then retest.
